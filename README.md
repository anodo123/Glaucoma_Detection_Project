****Glaucoma Detection Project****
**Overview**
This project implements a deep learning system for detecting glaucoma in retinal images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and U-Net architectures. The model achieves an accuracy of up to 92%, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment of this critical condition.

**Features**
High Accuracy: Achieves up to 92% accuracy in glaucoma detection.
Real-Time Analysis: Capable of analyzing retinal images in real-time to assist clinicians.
Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Image Processing: OpenCV
Numerical Computation: NumPy
**Dataset**
The dataset folder contains:

Model: Pre-trained models for quick inference.
Training Data: A comprehensive set of retinal images, including both healthy and glaucomatous samples.
Testing Data: A separate set of images for evaluating model performance.
**Usage**
The Model can be tesed on test dataset or on newer retinal images.
The Code for testing the model is provided in the python notebook.

**Future Work**
Improve model accuracy through transfer learning and additional preprocessing techniques.
Develop a user-friendly interface for clinicians to facilitate the diagnosis process.
