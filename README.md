**Glaucoma Detection Project**
Overview
This project implements a deep learning system for detecting glaucoma in retinal images using CNN and U-Net architectures. The model achieves up to 92% accuracy, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Features
High accuracy in glaucoma detection
Real-time analysis of retinal images
Technologies
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Dataset
The dataset folder contains:

Model: Pre-trained models for quick inference.
Training Data: A comprehensive set of retinal images used to train the model, including both healthy and glaucomatous samples.
Testing Data: A separate set of images used to evaluate the model's performance.
Usage
Place retinal images in the data directory.
Train the model using the training data.
Predict on new images using the testing data.
Future Work
Improve model accuracy through transfer learning and additional preprocessing techniques.
Develop a user-friendly interface for clinicians.
